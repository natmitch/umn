"""
* Run the provided program. Note that nothing forces you to write the name
  "properly"â€”e.g., as "Jane" instead of "jAnE".
  You will use list comprehensions to fix this.

  * First, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains
    the lowercase version of each of the names your user provided.

  * Then, use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains
    the title-cased versions of each of the names in your lower-cased list.

  **Bonuses**
	Instead of creating a lower-cased list and _then_ a title-cased list, create the title-cased list in a single comprehension.
